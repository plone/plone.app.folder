- Match ``getObjectPositionInParent`` behavior and handle unordered folders
  inside ordered folders shown in the navigation tree at the same time.

------------------

  indexing completely if the fake index has been installed.

- Replace monkey patch for `Catalog._getSortIndex` with a fake index that
  can sort search results according to their position in the container.

  "all results in one folder" case.
  [witsch]

- Add adapter for previous/next support that doesn't need the catalog.
  [witsch]

- Remove `getObjPositionInParent` catalog index and use a sort index based
  on the folder's order information instead.
