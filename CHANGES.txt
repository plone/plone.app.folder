1.0b7 - 2010-06-03
------------------

  which was removed for Plone 4.
  [davisagli]


1.0b6 - 2010-05-02

- Nogopip vs. Acquisition take two - not all folders have a getOrdering
  method, so we need to avoid acquiring it.

- Match ``getObjectPositionInParent`` behavior and handle unordered folders
  inside ordered folders shown in the navigation tree at the same time.

------------------

- Don't try to store an acquisition-wrapped catalog on the positional index.
  [hannosch]


1.0b3 - 2010-02-18
------------------

- Only apply monkey patch for `reindexOnReorder` on Plone 3.x & shortcut
  indexing completely if the fake index has been installed.
  [witsch]

- Replace monkey patch for `Catalog._getSortIndex` with a fake index that
  can sort search results according to their position in the container.
  [witsch]

- Add optimization for sorting results by folder position for the usual
  "all results in one folder" case.
  [witsch]

- Add adapter for previous/next support that doesn't need the catalog.
  [witsch]

- Remove `getObjPositionInParent` catalog index and use a sort index based
  on the folder's order information instead.
  [witsch]


1.0b2 - 2010-01-28
------------------

- Add `IATBTreeFolder` to `implements` list of `ATFolder` replacement.
